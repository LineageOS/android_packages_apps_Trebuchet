      "message": "It feels a bit weird with this change, it makes pressing the back button (or doing the back gesture) both dismisses the keyboard and clears the search/text field.\n\nThis also makes somewhat inconsistent user experience, the behavior every else where there is a text field and the keyboard is visible, pressing the back button (or doing the back gesture) only dismisses the keyboard and leaves the text field intact.",

I couldn\u0027t find any proper way to see if keyboard is showing other than getSystemService(InputMethodManager.class).isActive();, which didn\u0027t work here as we still want the textbox being active (in order to capture more back key events).\nThis way it\u0027s still a bit better to allow back key do what it\u0027s supposed to.",
