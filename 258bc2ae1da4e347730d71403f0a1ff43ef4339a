      "message": "I might have a suggestion for you about where else to include the page count stat. There\u0027s a call back in Launcher.java for bindScreens(AL\u003clong\u003e ids) that will get called when the launcher model has read in the db and has loaded up the screens that need to be bound to the workspace. So if we report this behavior there we could remove some of the chatter in the stats and only be notified once when the users workspace pages have been loaded instead of on every onResume.",

      "message": "Hm, should we rely on the workspace to aggregate this data? I think this is stored in the LauncherModel before binding. More specifically this instance variable in LauncherModel seems more appropriate:\n\n    // sBgAppWidgets is all LauncherAppWidgetInfo created by LauncherModel. Passed to bindAppWidget()\n    static final ArrayList\u003cLauncherAppWidgetInfo\u003e sBgAppWidgets\n\nMight be easier to report this array\u0027s size through a public method in LauncherModel instead. (Launcher activity already has a reference to the Model so not a lot of extra work needed).",
