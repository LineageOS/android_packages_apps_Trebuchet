      "message": "I think this occurred quickly enough that no jank was seen, the loop just below this loop that hid all the icons would occur between frames. Even on slower devices that I tested. However, to address this, I have added code above in the latest patchset to hide the icons and folders before they are ever added to the workspace.",
