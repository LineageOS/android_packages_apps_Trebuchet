      "message": "Should you also do something to release the resources for the alternate drawer type that you\u0027ve switched away from? I notice that there is no loading whatsoever once I\u0027ve loaded both drawers and I switch back and forth, so it seems like both of them with all the icons are held in memory. \n\nI\u0027m not sure what code you would change to adjust that at the moment, but just a thought.",

      "message": "The legacy app drawer code is fairly intermingled between the apps page and the widgets page, so I didn\u0027t take a crack at this for the time being. But its definitely a memory concern, and needs to be addressed in the near future.",
